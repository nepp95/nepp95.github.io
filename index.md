## About
Hi, I'm Niels Eppenhof! I enjoy tinkering with code because it’s a great way to learn and explore new ideas. Whether it's a random simulation or a game engine project, I’m always exploring something new. It's not about perfection, just the joy of figuring things out and improving over time. Most of my projects are made in C++ in which I've also made a reusable framework for smaller projects. Feel free to reach out to discuss anything, whether it's collaboration, feedback or simply just to talk!

## Current Projects
- EppoEngine
    - A long running project in which I use the development of a game engine to teach myself different aspects of what goes into game development. Think graphical programming (OpenGL, Vulkan), using .NET as a scripting language inside C++, data serialization, UX/UI design, and more.
- EppoChat
    - A cozy project of which the goal was to learn more about networking and the interaction in realtime between multiple clients and a server
- This website - As you can probably tell.
